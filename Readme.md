BetterBoard
===========

This is an attempt to build an alternative to Blackboard for my specific course.

It is a module to be used with [SilverStripe 3](http://www.silverstripe.org/).

Some of the built in features:

 - All lectures PDFs/Lectopia
 - All readings (required/additional/recommended)
 - Get notification style updates of things that have been added since you last visited
 - Ability to vote on the "Yield" of each lecture or reading
 - Sign up to easily keep track of lectures or readings you have completed
 - Signed in users can add/update Readings and Lectures (for example add the link to Lectopia once it becomes available)
 - Built in Quiz section for each week that you can add questions to
 - Scales to work beautifully on any size device (Laptop/iPad/Mobile)
 - Each weeks objectives and cases
